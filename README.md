# OftenDeck

## Microjournal Rev.2.ReVamp Custom ROM

A custom settings built on RasPi OS Lite for the Microjournal Rev.2.ReVamp.

**The image if my sd card is not uploaded yet. I need to remove some personal files first.**

The goal of this project is to work on the software side of building a writerdeck using Raspberry Pi OS Lite (for now) and Raspberry Pi Zero 2w. The goal is fast boot times, custom navigation, seamless file sharing, and a tailored writing environment.
