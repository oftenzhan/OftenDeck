# Tutorial Part 1B - Managing Buffers and Open Files

## Getting Started with Part 1B

As you can see, we are on the second file for the first tutorial titled Tutorial Part 1B. Let's move to the other screen by pressing rightknob, then we'll toggle off the navigation tree by again pressing `Shift-Leftknob`.


## Cycling Through Open Documents

Now, whenever you open up a new document, the old previous files are still open, just running in the background. When I press, not rotate, the leftknob, it will rotate between all the documents running in the background. When I press it once, you'll see the TutorialPart1A.md. When I press it again, you will see the Welcome Screen, then the Scratch screen, and then back to this file, TutorialPart1B.md.


## Returning to Tutorial Part 1A

I'll meet you back at the Tutorial Part 1A. See you there.
