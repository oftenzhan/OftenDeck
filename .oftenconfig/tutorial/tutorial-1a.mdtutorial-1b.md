# Tutorial Part 1B - Managing Buffers and Open Files

## Getting Started with Part 1B

As you can see, we are on the second file for the first tutorial entitled Tutorial Part 1B. To practice, let's toggle back and forth from the main screen to the sidebar by pressing `leftknob`, then we'll toggle off the navigation tree by pressing `shift-leftknob`.

## Cycling Through Open Documents

Now, whenever you open up a new document, the previous files that were opened are still running in the background. When I press the `rightknob`, the OftenDeck will rotate between all the opened documents running in the background. Watch when I press the `rightknob` multiple times; we will cycle through all the files currently opened including `tutorial-1a.md`, the Emacs' welcome screen, the scratch buffer, and other buffers. Eventually, it will come around full circle back to this document. 

## Returning to Tutorial Part 1A

Press the `rightknob` once to go back the previously opened document, which was `tutorial-1a.md`. We'll finish the tutorial there. See you there.
