Notes:
- There used to be a popular emacs mode called Muse, but it was replaced by org mode. it's not as flexible, and it was meant more for writing. 
- markdown has a format is useful because it is used for many types of programs. it's meant to be readable and plain text format, and it's used for a lot of other programs like making blogs (Hugo & Jekyll) and comments (GitHub, Reddit, Discord, etc.); while org mode formatting is very useful, It is not a language that is used in other popular programs. If org mode markup is used for writing stories, it will probably have to be exported.
