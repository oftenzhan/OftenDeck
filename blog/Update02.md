# OftenDeck Vision  â€“ Blog Update 2

OftenDeck is...

- a suite of customized FOSS apps for a compact, low-power computers.
- designed to be a central writing hub that supports the entire creative writing process from research, prewriting, drafting, to publication.
- TUI and Emacs centric.
   - This is for two reasons. (1) It uses less RAM. (2) You can ssh into the device and work on it remotely in a local WIFI-AP network.

OftenDeck is meant to be used as both local computing (as in, you just type directly onto the microdeck) and local hosting (as in, you can edit and save documents from your phone or computer using your internet browser, like an internet-less Google docs).

This suite was built on a MicroJournal Rev.2.ReVamp so special considerations were made for smallish LCD screens with an ultra-wide aspect ratio.
